## 🏭 AtliQ Computer Hardware Manufacturing Data Analysis (2018–2022, 1.8M+ Records)

This project is an **end-to-end data analysis** of AtliQ Hardware’s manufacturing and sales data (2018–2022, 1.8M+ records) using **Python, SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning**.  

The goal was to provide unified insights across **Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain** to support better strategic decisions.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Programming & Libraries:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Database:** MySQL (Advanced Queries, Summaries, Indexing)  
- **Visualization & Modeling:** Power BI (Snowflake Schema, DAX, DAX Studio Optimization)  
- **Machine Learning:** Discount Anomaly Detection, Customer Segmentation, Product Recommendation System

## 📂 Project Workflow
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – handled missing values, merged multi-year data, and performed integration using Pandas.  
- **SQL Analysis** – generated business summaries (Profit, Sales, Margins), advanced aggregations, and optimized queries for large datasets.  
- **Data Modeling (Snowflake Schema)** – designed fact and dimension tables to create a scalable and efficient Power BI data model.  
- **Power BI Dashboard** – built interactive dashboards for:
  - Finance (P&L, Margin Tracking)  
  - Sales (Customer Performance, Region-wise Sales)  
  - Marketing (Campaign Impact, Product Trends)  
  - Supply Chain (Inventory, Demand Fulfillment)  
  - Executive View (Unified KPIs)  
- **Performance Optimization** – optimized model size & performance using DAX Studio.  
- **Machine Learning Applications** –  
  - **Discount Anomaly Detection** – identified unusual discount patterns.  
  - **Customer Segmentation (Clustering)** – grouped customers by purchasing behavior.  
  - **Recommendation System** – suggested Top 5 products per customer using purchase history.

## 💡 Insights & Recommendations
- **Sales Performance** – Certain regions showed a consistent sales decline. Further analysis revealed issues such as regional pricing mismatches and unmet customer demands.  
  🔹 *Recommendation:* Collaborate with regional teams to revise pricing strategies and run targeted campaigns.  
- **Discount Policy** – ML-based anomaly detection revealed irregular discounting patterns that were eroding margins.  
  🔹 *Recommendation:* Implement stricter discount approval mechanisms to protect profitability.  
- **Customer Segmentation** – Clustering highlighted high-value customers and low-engagement groups.  
  🔹 *Recommendation:* Design personalized promotions and loyalty programs for high-value segments.  
- **Inventory Management** – Supply chain dashboards indicated overstocking in some SKUs while others faced stockouts.  
  🔹 *Recommendation:* Adopt demand-driven inventory planning using forecasting models.

## 🎯 What I Learned
- Dashboards and Data Visualizations don’t just provide answers; they **trigger the right questions** for deeper investigation.  
- For example, sales dashboards showed regional drops, which led to identifying root causes like **pricing issues** and **unmet customer needs**.  
- Asking these questions encouraged **cross-team collaboration** with Sales & Marketing to redesign strategies.  
- This project emphasized the importance of blending **technical analysis with business context** to drive impactful decisions.
