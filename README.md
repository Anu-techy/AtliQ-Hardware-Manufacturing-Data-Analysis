# 🏭 AtliQ Hardware Manufacturing Data Analysis (2018–2022, 1.8M+ Records)

This project is an **end-to-end data analysis** of AtliQ Hardware’s manufacturing and sales data (2018–2022, 1.8M+ records) using **Python, SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning**.  

The goal was to provide unified insights across **Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain** to support better strategic decisions and detect anomalies in business processes.

## 📂 Project Workflow
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – handled missing values, merged multi-year data, and performed integration using Pandas.  
- **SQL Analysis** – generated business summaries (Profit, Sales, Margins), advanced aggregations, and optimized queries for large datasets.  
- **Data Modeling (Snowflake Schema)** – designed fact and dimension tables to create a scalable and efficient Power BI data model.  
- **Power BI Dashboard** – built interactive dashboards for:
  - Finance (P&L, Margin Tracking)  
  - Sales (Customer Performance, Region-wise Sales)  
  - Marketing (Campaign Impact, Product Trends)  
  - Supply Chain (Inventory, Demand Fulfillment)  
  - Executive View (Unified KPIs)  
- **Performance Optimization** – optimized model size & performance using DAX Studio.  
- **Machine Learning Applications** –  
  - **Discount Anomaly Detection** – identified unusual discount patterns.  
  - **Customer Segmentation (Clustering)** – grouped customers by purchasing behavior.  
  - **Recommendation System** – suggested Top 5 products per customer using purchase history.

Aim

To Build a Comprehensive report of the company with a Home page having links to the following views

•	Finance View
•	Sales View
•	Marketing View
•	Supply Chain View
•	Executive View
•	Support View

Steps Involved: 

1. Understanding Business Model
2. Data Collection and Integration
3. Preprocessing
4. Data Modelling
5. Report Optimization
6. Creating Dashboards for all the views
7. Actionable Insights & Recommendations

What I learnt:

Dashboards and Data Visualizations don’t just provide answers; they prompt users to ask critical questions about the data which they might not have considered otherwise. 
This process helps users identify potential problems and focus on areas that require attention.

For instance, 
In the sales dashboard, the numbers prompted me to ask why sales were dropping in certain regions. 
This led to deeper analysis and uncovering factors like regional pricing issues or unmet customer needs. 
One could collaborate with the regional teams to adjust pricing strategies and develop targeted marketing efforts to improve sales in those regions.
