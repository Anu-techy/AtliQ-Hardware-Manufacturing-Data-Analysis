What I learnt:

Dashboards and Data Visualizations don’t just provide answers; they prompt users to ask critical questions about the data which they might not have considered otherwise. 
This process helps users identify potential problems and focus on areas that require attention.

For instance, 
In the sales dashboard, the numbers prompted me to ask why sales were dropping in certain regions. 
This led to deeper analysis and uncovering factors like regional pricing issues or unmet customer needs. 
One could collaborate with the regional teams to adjust pricing strategies and develop targeted marketing efforts to improve sales in those regions.
